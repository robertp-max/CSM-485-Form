# Learner Guide — CMS-485 Training Experience

## Purpose
This guide helps learners complete the CMS-485 training smoothly and confidently. It explains navigation, audio use, challenge behavior, accessibility support, and session expectations.

## Training Flow Overview
Each topic card follows a consistent flow:
1. **Main Topic View**
   - Learning Objective
   - Key Points
   - Clinical Lens
2. **Additional Subject Content**
   - Opened by selecting **PLAY** (or equivalent Next progression)
   - Includes expanded context for the current topic
3. **Challenge**
   - Topic check for understanding
   - Submission-based result with immediate feedback

After challenge completion, learners continue to the next topic.

## Navigation Controls
- **Back**
  - Reverses the current state in order:
    - Challenge → Additional Content
    - Additional Content → Main Topic View
    - Main Topic View → Previous Topic Card
- **Next**
  - Advances through current topic states before moving to the next topic:
    - Main Topic View → Additional Content
    - Additional Content → Challenge
    - Challenge → Next Topic Card

## Help Panel
A **Help** button is available near the primary navigation controls.

### Open Help
- Select **Help** to open the learner help panel.
- Current content (main/additional/challenge) transitions out, and Help transitions in.

### Close Help
- The button label changes to **Close Help Tab** while Help is open.
- Select it to return to the exact content state you were viewing before opening Help.

## Audio Controls
When audio controls are active, learners can use:
- **PLAY** — starts playback for the current topic
- **Pause** — pauses playback
- **Stop** — stops and resets playback position
- **Restart** — restarts playback from the beginning

If audio is unavailable for a topic, the UI displays status text indicating that no recording exists.

## Challenge Behavior
- Challenge unlock follows current training rules for the active topic.
- Learners can select one option and submit once per session for that topic.
- After submission:
  - Correct answer is highlighted in teal
  - Submitted incorrect answer is highlighted in red
  - Correct-answer explanation is shown when needed
- Challenge attempts remain session-locked for that topic.

## Progress and Session Expectations
- In-progress location is retained for continuity.
- Challenge attempt state is preserved for the active session.
- Session reset/new session behavior depends on platform launch context and implementation rules.

## Accessibility and Usability
The experience is designed to support:
- Keyboard navigation
- Visible focus indicators
- Live status updates for key actions
- Reduced motion preferences when enabled at OS/browser level

## Troubleshooting
### Audio does not start
- Verify system output device and browser tab audio settings.
- Confirm browser autoplay/media permissions.

### Challenge appears locked
- Ensure the current topic’s prerequisites were completed.
- Confirm you are on the intended topic state.

### Progress seems stale
- Refresh once and relaunch from the same LMS/module entry point.

## Support Checklist for Learners
Before reporting an issue, capture:
- Topic title and card number
- Current state (main/additional/challenge/help)
- Action taken (button clicked)
