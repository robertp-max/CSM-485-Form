Branding Assets Placement

Put your official PNG logo files in this folder with these exact names:

- logo-dark.png  -> for light backgrounds
- logo-light.png -> for dark backgrounds

Current app usage:
- `src/App.tsx` uses `/branding/logo-dark.png` in the header.

Recommended specs:
- Format: PNG with transparent background
- Width: 1200px to 2200px
- File size target: under 1 MB each for fast Moodle loading

If your LMS screen has dark headers, use `logo-light.png` for that surface.
