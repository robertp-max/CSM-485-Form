CMS-485 TRAINING CARD CONTENT

CARD 1
Header: What CMS-485 Is and Why It Matters
Section: Foundation
Objective: Define CMS-485 as the Plan of Care format and connect it to payment and survey outcomes.
Bullet Points:
- CMS-485 is a structured Plan of Care representation used to communicate ordered home health services.
- Defensible POC documentation supports clinician decision-making, patient safety, and reimbursement integrity.
- Weak or inconsistent POC content is a common root cause of denials and condition-level survey findings.
Audit Focus: Reviewer expectation: one coherent story from certification through claim.

CARD 2
Header: Why Documentation Quality Drives Outcomes
Section: Foundation
Objective: Explain the operational impact of complete and traceable POC documentation.
Bullet Points:
- High-quality documentation reduces claim rework and prevents preventable ADR escalation.
- Clear skilled rationale improves interdisciplinary execution and handoff quality.
- Documentation quality is both a compliance control and a care-quality control.

CARD 3
Header: CoPs Authority for the Plan of Care
Section: Regulatory Authority
Objective: Tie Plan of Care expectations to Conditions of Participation requirements.
Bullet Points:
- The Plan of Care must be established and periodically reviewed by the authorized practitioner.

CARD 5
Header: Certification vs Recertification
Section: Certification Lifecycle
Objective: Differentiate certification and recertification requirements in practical workflow terms.
Bullet Points:
- Certification establishes initial eligibility and plan authorization for the episode window.
- Recertification must reflect ongoing need and updated clinical status, not copy-forward text.
- Certification cycles must remain synchronized with reassessment and care progression.

CARD 6
Header: Recertification Drift Risk
Section: Certification Lifecycle
Objective: Prevent recertification failures caused by stale goals or unchanged rationale.
Bullet Points:
- Unchanged goals across episodes can signal poor clinical reassessment and weak necessity support.
