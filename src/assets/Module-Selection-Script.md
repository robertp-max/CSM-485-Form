Module Selection Page — Narration Script

00:00 — Introduction
Welcome. This screen lists the course modules and shows your progress. You'll see a header labeled "Module Selection" and the title "Course Modules." Use this page to open any unlocked topic and track what you've completed.

00:15 — Progress Indicator
At the top-right there is a compact progress bar and a counter. The bar fills as you complete topics; the counter shows completed topics over the total. This gives a quick view of your overall course progress.

00:30 — Module Tiles Overview
The main area is a grid of module tiles, each numbered in sequence. Tiles have three states:
- Locked: grayed out and marked with a lock icon — you cannot open these yet.
- Topic (current): numbered and active — tap or click to open the module.
- Completed: marked with a check icon — indicates you finished that topic.

00:55 — Opening a Module
Select any unlocked tile to open the topic. If the tile is disabled, you won't be able to select it; follow the course order to unlock later modules.

01:10 — Tile Details
Each tile shows the module number, a short title, and a small status label: "Locked", "Topic", or "Completed." Hover or focus states give a stronger visual cue to help you pick the active topic.

01:25 — Navigation and Controls
Use the Next and Back controls within a module to move through content cards. Keyboard left and right arrows perform the same actions. Navigation respects prerequisites — you must complete required steps before the challenge unlocks.

01:40 — Audio and Additional Content
When available, audio narration and additional content are provided inside a module. Play will start narration and expose extra material; pause, resume, and restart controls are available while audio is active.

01:55 — Challenge Availability
Challenges become available after required content is reviewed or audio finishes. You get one attempt per session for each challenge; after submission the correct answer and rationale are shown.

02:10 — Accessibility Notes
This page supports keyboard navigation and visible focus states. Status changes (playback, locks, completion) are announced via live text regions for screen readers.

02:25 — Tips
- Follow the sequence to avoid locked modules.
- Use the progress bar to confirm how much remains.
- If playback fails, check browser media permissions and device output.

02:40 — Closing
That covers the Module Selection page. Select an unlocked module to begin, and return here any time to resume or check progress.
